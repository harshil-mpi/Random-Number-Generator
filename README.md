# Random-Number-Generator
This supplemental material contains the code and the generated random numbers.

## Running the Code
The code can be executed directly on D-Wave's Leap IDE: https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap or locally by installing D-Wave Ocean: https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/.

## Code in QRNGCodes
* unbiased_qrng.py : Generates unbiased random numbers.
* biased_qrng.py : Generates biased random numbers for a fixed output bias.
* all_bias.py : Generates sequences for equally spaced qubit biases (used to determine the temperature, e.g. Sec. 5.1).  

## Data as CSV Files
### Sec. 5.2 Unbiased Random Numbers:
* RawRandomNumbers : 10 sequences of unbiased random numbers generated on 2000Q (400,000) and Advantage (990,000)
* VonNeumannPostProcessedRandomNumbers : The 10 sequences after Von Neumann post-processing.
* LargeSequences : Single long sequence of random numbers generated on the Advantage. Before and after post-processing.  
### Sec. 5.3 Biased Random Numbers:
BiasRandomNumbers : Biased random numbers generated on the 2000Q. 
* 1000_chim_all_bias_values.csv and 1000_peg_all_bias_values.csv contain random numbers for all bias values (generated by all_bias.py). 
* These are then used for temperature determination in chim_mean.py, etc..
* Finally, chimera_qubits=2000_bias=0.1.csv contains generated biased bits based on the determined temperature using biased_qrng.py.
